Utilities for banana-rdf
========================

This project is a collection of packages developed at the
[Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities](http://mith.umd.edu/)
to supplement the [W3C](http://www.w3.org/)'s
[`banana-rdf`](https://github.com/w3c/banana-rdf)
library with support for
[RDF JSON](http://docs.api.talis.com/platform-api/output-types/rdf-json)
and [JSON-LD](http://json-ld.org/) serialization
(currently only for [Jena](http://jena.apache.org/)),
automatic schema binding generation, etc.

See [this blog post](http://meta.plasm.us/posts/2013/06/19/macro-supported-dsls-for-schema-bindings/)
for an introduction to the experimental schema binding DSL.
